- [Installation Information](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Installing-BHoM)

  Note: You __must__ close Rhino/Excel/Dynamo for the installation to work
       (The programs need to be closed to allow toolbars and components to be added!)
  We recommend using the [BHoM Installer](https://bhom.xyz/installer) to get started.
